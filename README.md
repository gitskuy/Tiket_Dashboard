# Ahmad Yazid Technical Test

Based on Vue.js admin template Developed by [Epicmax](https://epicmax.co/).
In order to get the desired output as needed by the technical test I have stumbeled upon
a framework template created by epicmax(https://github.com/epicmaxco/vuestic-admin) which happens to be exactly like the one required on the technical test. After a couple of days of reading the documentation and also learning the structure of the template I have managed to recreate the output that is needed by the test (exactly the same). When you first run the project you will be sent to a landing page after you click the dashboard button you will arrive at the dashboard.
